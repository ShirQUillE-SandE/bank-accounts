# bank-accounts
 ## This is a simulate bank account balances for three individuals.

The Balance according to my code are as below

wanjiru's balance is: 127.5
juma's balance is: 5550.51
linda's balance is: 2257.0

To make the simulation more realistic, it would be okay if there was an unput fuction that prompts the account 
holder to input his/her ammount which is then stored a a variable then it is cummulated and executed according the
souurce code. 


HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
Copy the code to an online IDE for example https://replit.com/languages/python3 then hit RUN! The above results will come up. 

Thank Kindly reach out incase of any further questions.
